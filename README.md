# Eight Puzzle Solver

The Eight Puzzle Solver is a Java application designed to solve the classic Eight Puzzle problem using the A* search algorithm. This program allows users to input the initial state of the puzzle and visualizes the solution path by exploring puzzle states efficiently.

## Features

- **User-Friendly Interface:** Users can input the initial state of the Eight Puzzle through a simple command-line interface.
- **A* Search Algorithm:** The solver utilizes the A* search algorithm to find the optimal solution by exploring puzzle states based on heuristic values.
- **Solution Visualization:** The program displays the series of moves required to solve the puzzle, providing users with a clear understanding of the solution path.
- **Efficient State Exploration:** Efficient state exploration techniques are implemented to minimize redundant expansion of puzzle states, improving performance.

## Usage

1. **Input Puzzle Configuration:** Users enter the initial state of the Eight Puzzle using numeric values (0 represents the blank tile).
2. **Solution Display:** The program outputs the series of moves required to solve the puzzle, showcasing the optimal solution path.
3. **Performance:** Utilizes heuristic functions to prioritize puzzle states, ensuring efficient exploration and solution discovery.
